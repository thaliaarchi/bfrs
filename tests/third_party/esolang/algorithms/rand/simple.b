[This simple script takes 2 inputs, and the cell next to x, and generates
something pseudorandom based off it. It:

- Asks for input
- Multiplies by 2 and stores in cell x+1
- Adds 4 to cell x+1
- Goes back to cell x and asks for input
- Adds cell x and cell x+1.

If you inputted the ASCII codes for 87 and 96, you would get 274, wrapping to
19.]
