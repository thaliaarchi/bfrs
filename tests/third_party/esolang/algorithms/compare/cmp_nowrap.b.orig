[z = sign(x-y) (non-wrapping)

Attribution: quintopia <https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Quintopia>

This is a comparison of two numbers for non-wrapping implementations. The signs
of the two numbers must be known. Part of it can also be used to find the sign
of an unknown number if both it and its opposite are available. z and the four
cells to its right must be free and clear (and will be again when the algorithm
terminates), an assumption that must be made in a non-wrapping implementation,
as the direction to clear these cells could not be known to this algorithm. The
code blocks indicated by parenthetical comments could contain code which depends
on the result of the comparison; there is no particular reason in practice to
wait for the value of z to be set to one of {-1,0,1}.

Put an {if 0, then do} algorithm at the end to run code conditional on y=x.
