[z = x > y

This uses balanced loops only, and requires a wrapping implementation (and will
be very slow with large numbers of bits, although the number of bits otherwise
doesn't matter.) The temporaries and x are left at 0; y is set to y-x. (You
could make a temporary copy of x via using another temporary that's incremented
during the loop.)]

temp0[-]temp1[-]z[-]
x[ temp0+
       y[- temp0[-] temp1+ y]
   temp0[- z+ temp0]
   temp1[- y+ temp1]
   y- x- ]
