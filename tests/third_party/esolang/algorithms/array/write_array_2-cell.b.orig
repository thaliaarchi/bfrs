[x(y) = z (1-d array) (2 cells/array element)

Attribution: Jeffry Johnston <https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Calamari>

The cells representing x, temp0, and temp1 must be contiguous, with x being the
leftmost cell and temp1 the rightmost, followed by adequate memory for the
array. Each array element requires 2 memory cells. The pointer ends at x.]

temp0[-]
temp1[-]
temp2[-]
y[temp1+temp2+y-]temp2[y+temp2-]
z[temp0+temp2+z-]temp2[z+temp2-]
x>>[[>>]+[<<]>>-]+
 [>>]<[-]<[<<]
 >[>[>>]<+<[<<]>-]
 >[>>]<<[-<<]

[The code up through "-]+" creates a trail of 1's that the later loops will use
to find the destination cell. The cells are grouped as "data cell, 1-cell". The
destination cell is "data cell, 0-cell", so that the "[>>]" stops in a useful
place. The x cell is always 0, and serves as the left-side stop for the "[<<]"
statements (notice that t1 is cleared by the first loop, but the loop's trailing
"+" converts it to the first 1-cell in the trail). Next, the trail is followed
and "[-]" clears the destination cell. The array is now prepared, so an add-to
loop of the form "temp0[dest+temp0-]" moves the value in temp0 to the
destination cell. Finally, with ">[>>]" the trail of 1's is followed one last
time forward, and cleared on the way back, ending at the left stop, x.
Contiguous memory required for the array is 3 + 2 * number of array elements.]
